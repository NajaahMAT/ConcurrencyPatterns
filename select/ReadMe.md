The select pattern in Go is a control flow construct that allows a goroutine to wait on multiple channel operations and execute different logic depending on which channel is ready first. This pattern is often used to implement timeouts, to multiplex input from multiple channels onto a single channel, or to implement non-blocking channel operations. The select pattern is a powerful tool for managing concurrent operations in Go and is a key part of many concurrency patterns.
package main

//Example-1 - blocking RPC operations executing in concurrent goroutines. Weâ€™ll use
//select to await both of these values simultaneously, printing each one as it arrives.


//Example 2:
Timeouts are important for programs that connect to external resources or that otherwise need to bound execution time. Implementing timeouts in Go is easy with the use of channels and select.

//Example 3:
Basic sends and receives on channels are blocking. However, we can use select with a default clause to implement non-blocking sends, receives, and even non-blocking multi-way selects.
