The worker pool pattern involves a collection of goroutines (workers) that are all listening on a single task channel. This pattern is useful for limiting the number of goroutines that are concurrently executing and controlling the level of concurrency. Itâ€™s often used in scenarios where you have a large number of tasks to be processed and you want to limit the number of tasks being processed at the same time.

Implementation
In this example, we demonstrate the worker pool pattern by creating a fixed number of worker goroutines that process tasks from a task channel. The main steps involved in the implementation are as follows:

Create a task struct that represents a unit of work to be performed.
Create a channel for task distribution between the main goroutine and the worker goroutines.
Launch the desired number of worker goroutines, each waiting to receive tasks from the task channel.
Generate a set of tasks to be processed.
Send tasks to the task channel.
Each worker goroutine listens on the task channel for incoming tasks, processes them, and outputs the result.
Wait for all worker goroutines to complete processing.
